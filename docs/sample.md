## Teams App That Fits

Microsoft Teams offers a collection of apps that are provided by Microsoft or external services. Teams apps can be tabs, bots, message extensions, or any combination of these capabilities. You can also extend Teams apps to work on Outlook and Microsoft 365 App, enhancing the Teams collaborative experience for users.

- **App Types**:  
  Apps can be personal or shared.  
  - **Personal App**: Enables one-on-one communication.  
  - **Shared App**: Allows multiple users to share app space for collaboration.

## Driving Organizational Goals

Collaboration and communication are key for an organization. The reliance on apps is increasing due to several factors:
- Concise communication.
- Integration with necessary services.
- On-the-go accessibility.

### Benefits of Apps

- Connect with customers.
- Provide services and share information.
- Facilitate collaboration and create a cohesive environment for business needs.
