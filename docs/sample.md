Microsoft Teams offers a variety of apps, provided by both Microsoft and external services. These apps can be tabs, bots, message extensions, or a combination of these capabilities. Additionally, Teams apps can be extended to work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App, enhancing the collaborative experience for users.
