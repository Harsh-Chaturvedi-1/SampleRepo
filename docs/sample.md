# Teams App That Fits

Microsoft Teams offers a collection of apps provided by Microsoft or external services. Teams apps can be tabs, bots, message extensions, or any combination of these capabilities. You can also extend Teams apps to work on Outlook and Microsoft 365 Apps, expanding the value of the Teams collaborative experience.

- **Personal Apps:** Enable one-on-one communication.
- **Shared Apps:** Allow multiple users to share app space for collaboration.

## Driving Organizational Goals

Effective collaboration and communication are crucial for any organization. Apps facilitate this through concise communication, integration with services, and accessibility. Organizations use apps to:

- Connect with customers
- Provide services
- Share information

Apps create a collaborative environment for both external and internal business needs. Here are some ways apps can fulfill business needs:
