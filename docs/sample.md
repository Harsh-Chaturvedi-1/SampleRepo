# Introduction to Teams Apps

Microsoft Teams offers a diverse collection of apps provided by Microsoft as well as external services. These Teams apps can be in the form of tabs, bots, message extensions, or any combination thereof. Additionally, you can extend Teams apps to work on Outlook and Microsoft 365 Apps, thereby expanding the collaborative value for users.
