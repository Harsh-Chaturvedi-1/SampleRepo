# Teams App That Fits

Microsoft Teams offers a collection of apps provided by Microsoft or external services. Teams apps can be tabs, bots, or message extensionsâ€”or any combination of these capabilities. These apps expand the value of the Teams collaborative experience for users and can also be extended to work on Outlook and Microsoft 365 Apps.

Key points include:
- **Personal apps:** Enable one-on-one communication.
- **Shared apps:** Allow multiple users to collaborate within an app space.
