# Building Apps for the Microsoft Teams Platform

Microsoft Teams offers a collection of apps provided by either Microsoft or external services. These apps can be tabs, bots, message extensions, or any combination of capabilities. Additionally, Teams apps can be extended to work on Outlook and Microsoft 365 App, enhancing the collaborative experience for users.

- **Types of Apps:**
  - **Personal Apps:** Enable one-on-one communication.
  - **Shared Apps:** Allow multiple users to share app space for collaboration.

## Driving Organizational Goals

Effective collaboration and communication are vital for organizational success. The following are reasons why apps are crucial for organizations:

- **Concise Communication and Service Integration:** Apps facilitate direct communication and integration with essential services.
- **On-the-Go Accessibility:** Ensures that team members have access wherever they are.
- **Connection and Collaboration Tools:** Apps are a meeting place for teamwork. They help build a cohesive environment for both external and internal business needs.

## Building Apps with Microsoft Teams

Teams apps enhance your collaborative workspace by bringing key information, tools, and processes into areas where people gather, learn, and work. Here's why Teams apps are best suited for your app needs:

1. **Communication and Collaboration**

   Teams apps allow users to pull information from another system, discuss it, and take action, all within the Teams client. Also, you can push information to a specific audience based on an event in an external system.

2. **Social Interactions**

   Teams provide a social platform that encourages extending company culture into collaboration spaces. Apps for polls, feedback, connection, and communication further enhance this.

3. **Common Business Processes**

   Repetitive tasks such as creating sales call reports, tracking projects, and submitting requests are perfect for Teams apps.

4. **Personal Apps with Tabs and Bots**

   One-to-one conversational bots provide a private space for interaction between a bot and a user. Shared bots can notify all users in a collaborative tool, replacing emails and phone calls.

5. **Surface Existing App**

   If you have an existing web application, it can be extended to Teams. This includes SharePoint sites, SPFx extensions, or PowerApps, thereby increasing user engagement.

6. **Teams Store Advantage**

   Publishing apps on the Teams Store not only improves availability but also serves as a marketing opportunity, especially for startups.

7. **Build Once, Run Everywhere**

   Extend your Teams app across Microsoft 365 to deliver cross-platform apps with a single codebase. Use the latest app manifest and Teams JavaScript client library for personal tab and message extension apps across platforms such as Outlook and Microsoft 365 app.
