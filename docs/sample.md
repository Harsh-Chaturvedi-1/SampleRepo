# Teams App Overview

Microsoft Teams provides a diverse collection of apps by both Microsoft and external services. These apps can be tabs, bots, or message extensions, or a combination of capabilities. Additionally, you can extend Teams apps to function in Outlook and Microsoft 365 Apps, enhancing the collaborative experience for users.

- **App Types:**
  - Personal Apps: Enable one-on-one communication.
  - Shared Apps: Allow multiple users to collaborate.

## Driving Organizational Goals

Effective collaboration and communication are crucial for organizational success. Apps help facilitate these by:

Organizations use apps to connect with customers, deliver services, and share information, fostering a cohesive environment for both external and internal business needs.
