# Teams App Overview

Microsoft Teams offers a collection of apps provided by Microsoft or external services. Teams apps can be tabs, bots, or message extensions, or any combination of these capabilities. You can extend Teams apps to work on Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App as well. These apps enhance the Teams collaborative experience for users.

- **Types of Apps**:
  - Personal apps: Enable one-on-one communication.
  - Shared apps: Allow multiple users to collaborate within the app space.

## Driving Organizational Goals

Collaboration and communication are key for an organization. Organizations rely on apps for:
